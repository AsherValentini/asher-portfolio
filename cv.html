      <!-- EXPERIENCE 1 -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Embedded Software Engineer</h3>
        <p><strong>Cellectric BioSciences | 2023 – Present (2 years)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Circuit Design: Designed and manufactured ESP32 architecture based circuits targeting the control of hardware such as stepper/solenoid drivers and I2C/SPI sensors.</li>
          <li>Firmware, RTOS & RPC Implementation: Created C++ firmware with Real-Time Operating Systems and RPC frameworks.</li>
          <li>GUI & Control Software: Built a cross-platform GUI (Qt) and Python3 application following OOP, MVC, and event-driven design patterns to ensure thread safety and modularity.</li>
          <li>DevOps & CI/CD: Established CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and packaging processes to streamline development and deployment.</li>
          <li>Microfluidic System: Designed a microfluidic subsystem integrating peristaltic and syringe pumps, solenoid valves, and sensor feedback (temperature, pressure, flow rate).</li>
