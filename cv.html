      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          A resourceful engineer who looks to take the initiative. 
          I am adept at developing original solutions but always happy to consider outside perspectives and build toward external ideas. Strong communicator and team player with a proven 
          track record in each layer of embedded systems engineering from circuits, to UI's, and all the software architecture in-between. I have 7YOE in C++ development, and enjoy leveraging 
          modern design patterns to optimize system performance and reliability.
